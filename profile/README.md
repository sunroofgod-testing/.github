As implied in the name of this organisation, it is currently owned by me: [github/sunroofgod](https://github.com/sunroofgod).

This organisation serves as a way for me to do testings that I otherwise wouldn't be able to on my personal, non-organisation, github account.

I am currently working on [forking workflow](https://github.com/sunroofgod-testing/forking-workflow) for production.

List of the tests I've done:
* [forking workflow](https://github.com/sunroofgod-testing/forking-workflow): optimisation of workflow for open-source based projects.
